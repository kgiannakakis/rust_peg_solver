//! This crate provides code for solving the [English peg solitaire puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)
//! and can produce image and gif solutions. The solver and input puzzle format is based on a
//! [Golang example](https://go.dev/test/solitaire.go). The code extends the existing sample so that it can work
//! with other variations of the puzzle, allowing the user to define a custom board.

/// - ○ represents a hole
/// - ◎ denotes the center position, starting with a hole
/// - ◉ denotes the center position, starting with a peg
